# Differential cases

Solver-neutral JSON specifications live in `cases/`. They describe physical
inputs and observable outputs without exposing any solver's internal field
layout. `case_schema.py` validates them before an adapter is allowed to run.

Oracle priority is explicit in every case:

1. analytical solution;
2. mathematical invariant;
3. independent-solver consensus;
4. historical BeamZ regression data.

External adapters should return only the named observables (for example
effective index, reflected power, or an S-parameter). Optional Meep and FDTDX
jobs can therefore be added without turning either solver into the sole truth.

## Rectilinear-grid references

`rectilinear_grid_references.json` contains frozen x/y grid-boundary coordinates
for the solver-neutral cases declared in `rectilinear_grid_cases.py`. The cases
cover a homogeneous domain, high-index and coupled rectangles, a ring/bus
coupler, an explicit mesh override, snapping points, and an enforced coarse
override. Keeping the fixture immutable makes changes to mesh density and
grading explicit in review while leaving the normal test suite independent of
external packages.
